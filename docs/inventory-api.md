# Inventory Management API Documentation

## Overview

The inventory management system provides comprehensive APIs for tracking product inventory across stores, managing stock movements, and monitoring inventory levels. The system enforces brand-based access control and role-based permissions.

## Authentication

All endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

## Permissions

### Role-based Access:
- **SYSTEM_ADMIN**: Full access to all inventory data across brands
- **BRAND_MANAGER**: Full access to their brand's inventory data  
- **STORE_MANAGER**: Read and update access to their brand's inventory
- **STAFF**: Read-only access to their brand's inventory

### Brand Scoping:
Non-admin users can only access inventory data for their assigned brand.

## Models

### ProductStore

Represents inventory of a specific product at a specific store.

**Fields:**
- `id` (UUID): Unique identifier
- `product` (UUID): Reference to Product
- `store` (UUID): Reference to Store  
- `quantity_on_hand` (integer): Current physical stock quantity
- `reserved_quantity` (integer): Quantity reserved for orders
- `minimum_stock_level` (integer): Minimum level for reorder alerts
- `available_quantity` (computed): quantity_on_hand - reserved_quantity
- `is_below_minimum` (computed): true if quantity_on_hand < minimum_stock_level

**Constraints:**
- Product and Store must belong to the same brand
- Reserved quantity cannot exceed quantity on hand
- Unique together: (product, store)

### StockMovement

Tracks all inventory movements and changes.

**Fields:**
- `id` (UUID): Unique identifier
- `product_store` (UUID): Reference to ProductStore
- `movement_type` (choice): INBOUND, OUTBOUND, TRANSFER, ADJUSTMENT
- `quantity` (integer): Change amount (positive for increases, negative for decreases)
- `reference_number` (string): External reference (PO, SO, etc.)
- `notes` (text): Additional details
- `created_by` (UUID): User who created the movement
- `destination_product_store` (UUID): For transfers, the destination ProductStore
- `created_at` (datetime): When the movement was created

**Business Rules:**
- INBOUND movements must have positive quantity
- OUTBOUND movements must have negative quantity  
- TRANSFER movements require a destination_product_store
- Stock movements automatically update ProductStore quantities
- Movements are immutable after creation (no updates allowed)

  -d '{
    "product_store": "product-store-uuid",
    "movement_type": "INBOUND", 
    "quantity": 100,
    "reference_number": "PO2024001",
    "notes": "Weekly inventory delivery"
  }'
```

### 2. Process Sale/Order

```bash
# Create outbound movement  
curl -X POST /api/stock-movements/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "product_store": "product-store-uuid",
    "movement_type": "OUTBOUND",

- User must have access to product's brand

## Rate Limiting
